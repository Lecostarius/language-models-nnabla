# Neural language models
Tiny implementation of neural language models with Sony's NNabla

## Requirements
- NNabla v0.9.7
- Keras v2.1.2 (for preprocessing)
- Numpy v1.13.3
- tqdm v4.19.5

## Models
- A vanilla ecurrent neural network language model (`rnnlm.py`)
- LSTM language model (`lstmlm.py`)

## Future work
- Character-level neural language model
- Skip-gram model
- Continuous-BoW model
